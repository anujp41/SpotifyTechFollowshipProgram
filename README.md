Responses to questions posed to Tech Fellowship Applicants

GitHub repository contains the solutions to 3 programming problems that are part of the application. Each questions has its own JavaScript file.

Each file contains variables that could be excluded from production but are nevertheless used in my code as I thought it would make it easier to review (for example, the `sArray` variable in `Question_1.js`).

I look forward to hearing back from you.
